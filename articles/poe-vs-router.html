<h1>PoE vs Router</h1>
<div class="meta">发布日期：2025-04-17 ｜ 作者：Oliver F.</div>
<p>1.The router can automatically assign IP to your LAN, virtual dial-up, just like a traffic policeman, directing your computer where to go, so you don&#39;t have to worry about it. It is only used to distribute network data. Switch. The switch is used to share a network cable, and the router is used to share an IP.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><p>The router is at the network layer. The router can handle TCP/IP protocol, but the switch cannot. The switch is at the relay layer. The router addresses according to the IP address, and the switch addresses according to the MAC address.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The router can assign an IP to many hosts for use, and these hosts only show one IP to the outside. The switch can connect many hosts, and these hosts have their own IP to the outside.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The router provides firewall services and has virtual dial-up Internet access functions, but the switch does not have these functions.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Hubs and switches are used for port expansion, which is to expand the access point of the LAN (usually Ethernet), that is, to allow more computers to be connected to the LAN. Routers are used for inter-network connections, that is, to connect different networks. Switches form a local area network, and routers form a wide area network.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In addition, what are the differences between POE switches and ordinary switches on the market?</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Reliability: POE switches are switches that support power supply to network cables. Compared with ordinary switches, the powered terminals (such as APs, digital cameras, etc.) do not need to be wired for power supply, which is more reliable for the entire network.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Different functions: POE switches can not only provide the transmission function of ordinary switches, but also provide power supply to the devices at the other end of the network cable.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Different advantages: POE switches have many advantages. In addition to not having to pull extra wires, they can also save costs, the system is more flexible, and later upgrades and maintenance are simple.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Different power supply methods: POE switches are switches that support power supply to network cables. They can not only realize the data transmission function of ordinary switches, but also power network terminals at the same time. Ordinary switches need power supply to work properly, and POE perfectly solves this problem.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Different control: The difference between POE switches and ordinary switches is that some high-performance PoE switches can also easily manage the power supply of each POE port and the entire device through a user-friendly operation interface, which is more convenient for control.</p>
</li>
</ol>
